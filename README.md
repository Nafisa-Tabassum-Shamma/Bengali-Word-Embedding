# Bengali Word Embedding

This repository contains the code, resources, and thesis for the Bengali Word Embedding project, which focuses on developing and evaluating word embedding models tailored for the Bengali language. This research contributes to natural language processing (NLP) for low-resource languages by providing robust models and detailed comparative analyses.

## Overview

Word embeddings are a key component in NLP, representing words in a continuous vector space to capture semantic relationships. This project focuses on:

- Developing Bengali word embeddings using **Gensim** and the **BanglaLM corpus**.
- Evaluating embeddings with **CNN** and **RNN** architectures.
- Comparing performance metrics against industry-standard models like **Facebookâ€™s FastText**.

The project results, including the authored thesis, provide valuable insights into improving NLP applications for the Bengali language.
